# Traffic Accident Analysis

## Summary
This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of traffic accidents across various cities in the United States. Utilizing Python and libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we uncover patterns and insights into the frequency and distribution of accidents. Key findings include the identification of cities with the highest reported accidents, the impact of time of day and week on accident occurrences, and the seasonal variation in accident rates. Additionally, geographical data visualization with Folium highlights accident distribution near bay areas.

## Key Findings
- **Top Cities for Accidents**: Miami, Houston, Los Angeles, Charlotte, Dallas, and others rank highest in reported accidents.
- **Accident Frequency**: About 8.9% of cities experience a high number of accidents, while the majority (91%) have a lower occurrence.
- **Single Accident Cities**: Over 1023 cities reported just one accident, indicating potential outliers.
- **Time-Based Trends**: Morning (7-8 AM) and evening (4-5 PM) rush hours show spikes in accidents, with distinct patterns on weekdays versus weekends.
- **Seasonal Variation**: Accident rates dip during summer and rise as winter approaches.
- **Geographical Insights**: Folium maps suggest a concentration of accidents near bay areas.

## Conclusion
Our analysis suggests significant correlations between accident frequencies and factors such as location, time of day, day of the week, and season. The presence of outliers, especially cities with a single reported accident, warrants further scrutiny. Future analyses could delve deeper into these aspects to better understand the dynamics of traffic accidents.
